## [Conversor image to oled display](https://github.com/Giovani-Pedroso/Converter-of-images-and-videos-to-128-x-64-display)
 


OLED displays are usefull no matter what is your project but some times they can be a bit borring only only showing texts and numbers, this project was made to converter images 
and gifs in a text that can be insert in your code, below you can see a gif of a girl displaing in a 128X64 OLED display this project can convert images to 4 diferents 
resolutions 128x64, 64x64, 64x32, 32x32.


 **Language** : Python
 
 **Frameworks/Libraries** : Kivy, OpenCV

## [Eletric maze](https://github.com/Giovani-Pedroso/electric-labyrinth) 


This was a better version of a project that I did in my college, the old one was made with Flip-flod and logic gates and 2 7-seg display, the new version is powered 
by an atmega328p the stopwatch is showing in an OLED display and also fiture a encoder to select the time to comple the circuit

 **Language** : C
 
 **Board/Uc** : Arduino Uno/Atmega328p
 
 **Main components** : OLED display 128x64 - SSD1306 ,Rotary encoder
  
 **Frameworks/Libraries** : Adafruit GFX, Adafruit SSD1306
 
 

##  [Lazer cat](https://github.com/Giovani-Pedroso/laser_cat/) 

 This project was one ofthe first thing I did with the arduino, personali I use always that start learning a new microcontroller  
 
 
 **Language** : C
 
 **Board/Uc** : Arduino Uno/Atmega328p
 
 **Main components** : Servo motor SG90, Laser diode
