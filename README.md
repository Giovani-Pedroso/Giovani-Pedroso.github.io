OLED displays are useful no matter what is your project but some times they can be a bit borring so I made this project 


 **Language** : Python
 
 **Frameworks/Libraries** : Kivy, OpenCV

### UI

## [Eletric maze](https://github.com/Giovani-Pedroso/electric-labyrinth) 


This was a better version of a project that I did in my college, the old one was made with Flip-flod and, logic gates
and 2 7-seg display, the new version is powered by an atmega328p the stopwatch is showing in an OLED display and also fiture a encoder to select the time to comple the circuit

 **Language** : C
 
 **Board/Uc** : Arduino Uno/Atmega328p
 
 **Main components** : OLED display 128x64 - SSD1306 ,Rotary encoder
  
 **Frameworks/Libraries** : Adafruit GFX, Adafruit SSD1306
 
 

##  [Lazer cat](https://github.com/Giovani-Pedroso/laser_cat/) 

 This project was one ofthe first thing i diy with the arduino, just a simple toy to distra cats, this projet 
 
 
 **Language** : C
 
 **Board/Uc** : Arduino Uno/Atmega328p
 
 **Main components** : Servo motor SG90, Laser diode
